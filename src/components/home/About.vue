    <p>Technologist and futurist. Master builder of nachos, hardware, and software.
    </p>
    <p>I'm a software and hardware nerd that loves to build things. I've spoken at hundreds of conferences and organize several Atlanta tech groups: Atlanta Java User Group, North Atlanta JavaScript Meetup, and Big Data Atlanta... as well as program chair for Devnexus and Connect.Tech. I've never met a programming platform I didn't like, except for Perl.
